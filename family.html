                <h1>My Family</h1>
                <p>I've tried to collect what little we know about our family on our <a href="https://aanddnotes.github.io/WebPages/family/history/familyTree.html">web site</a>, although there is still a lot to find out, particularly about my grandparents. A small part of our combined family tree is reproduced here, just to show my immediate connections and to put any other comments into context. I've put down those comments really just as I've thought of them, without any particular plan.</p>

                <p>Throughout my life I've strived (but failed) to work as hard as my Father. When we were growing up, right through to when he was looking after Mum, supporting his family was his priority and he worked physically hard to do it. On the occassion when he was made redundant he obtained another job the next day. And it wasn't just when he had a family to support, although that became his main motivation, since even his childhood seemed to be full of doing odd jobs so as to earn money, most of which was given to his mother. When I 'interviewed' him to find out more about his life it became evident that he'd had more jobs than most people have hot dinners. Basically he would turn his hand to anything that gave hime some income.</p>
                <p>My first recollection of his job was when he was working for Tom Welsh as a driver cum manual labourer. Tom had contracts with various transport organisations to buy their old lorry tyres. Tom and Dad would collect them from the various sites around the country, sort the tyres into those that could be re-cut (have a new tread cut into the remaining rubber), re-molded (have a new layer of rubber molded onto the tyre carcass) or were scrap. Each category then got sold on. Tom seemed quite generous and Dad would often come home with fruit or meat that Tom had bought. However, when Tom died, the business was taken over by his son Den, who didn't seem to have quite the same business sense. After a while he stopped that trade and openned a 'shop', in a back street in Tottenham, selling and fitting car tyres. Business wasn't good (they had no passing trade) and it was Den who made Dad redundant.</p>
                <p>During our childhood, at least while we lived in Potters Bar, Mum would have a part-time job, usually in some kind of assembly or light engineering firm. To them both, work was what life was about. Education was important (they had both left school at 14), but their expectation was that their children would leave school as soon as they could and find a job. Having said that, they left the decision as to whether or not I wanted to stay on at school to me. At that time you could leave school at 16, after taking GCE or RSA exams, and they suported my choice. They had no experience of people staying in education and did not have the background to be able to provide any 'academic' support. However, Mum was quite a fervent knitter. We certainly were never without a sweater or cardigan!</p>
                <p>Mum would read 'magazines', Dad would read a newspaper and I was a llowed a weekly comic, but there were no books around the house apart from a set of encyclopedias. These were bought from Mum's cousin, who worked for the publisher. The set of eight books had one page where half the page was over printed, so we got them cheap. I had always been a poor reader and am slow to this day. I suspect that not reading much was the cause of my poor spelling. It wasn't until I was about 14 that I joined the public library.</p>
                <p>Alan was born while we lived in Cheshunt and was five and a half years my junior. This really meant that we had little in common during our childhood. It wasn't until I left home for university that Alan was reaching an age where we could have overlapping interests. He married Chris a couple of years after our marriage, but we have always lived some disance away and so only make occassional visits.</p>
