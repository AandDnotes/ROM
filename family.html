                <h1>My Family</h1>
                <p>I've tried to collect what little we know about our family on our <a href="https://aanddnotes.github.io/WebPages/family/history/familyTree.html">web site</a>, although there is still a lot to find out, particularly about my grandparents. A small part of our combined family tree is reproduced here, just to show my immediate connections and to put any other comments into context. I've put down those comments really just as I've thought of them, without any particular plan.</p>

                <p>Throughout my life I've strived (but failed) to work as hard as my Father. When we were growing up, right through to when he was looking after Mum, supporting his family was his priority and he worked physically hard to do it. On the occasion when he was made redundant he obtained another job the next day. And it wasn't just when he had a family to support, although that became his main motivation, since even his childhood seemed to be full of doing odd jobs so as to earn money, most of which was given to his mother. When I 'interviewed' him to find out more about his life it became evident that he'd had more jobs than most people have hot dinners. Basically he would turn his hand to anything that gave hime some income.</p>
                <p>My first recollection of his job was when he was working for Tom Welsh as a driver cum manual labourer. Tom had contracts with various transport organisations to buy their old lorry tyres. Tom and Dad would collect them from the various sites around the country, sort the tyres into those that could be re-cut (have a new tread cut into the remaining rubber), re-moulded (have a new layer of rubber moulded onto the tyre carcass) or were scrap. Each category then got sold on. Tom seemed quite generous and Dad would often come home with fruit or meat that Tom had bought. However, when Tom died, the business was taken over by his son Den, who didn't seem to have quite the same business sense. After a while he stopped that trade and opened a 'shop', in a back street in Tottenham, selling and fitting car tyres. Business wasn't good (they had no passing trade) and it was Den who made Dad redundant.</p>
                <p>During our childhood, at least while we lived in Potters Bar, Mum would have a part-time job, usually in some kind of assembly or light engineering firm. To them both, work was what life was about. Education was important (they had both left school at 14), but their expectation was that their children would leave school as soon as they could and find a job. Having said that, they left the decision as to whether or not I wanted to stay on at school to me. At that time you could leave school at 16, after taking GCE or RSA exams, and they supported my choice. They had no experience of people staying in education and did not have the background to be able to provide any 'academic' support. However, Mum was quite a fervent knitter. We certainly were never without a sweater or cardigan!</p>
                <p>Mum would read 'magazines', Dad would read a newspaper and I was allowed a weekly comic, but there were no books around the house apart from a set of encyclopaedias. These were bought from Mum's cousin, who worked for the publisher. The set of eight books had one page where half the page was over printed, so we got them cheap. I had always been a poor reader and am slow to this day. I suspect that not reading much was the cause of my poor spelling. It wasn't until I was about 14 that I joined the public library.</p>
                <p>Alan was born while we lived in Cheshunt and was five and a half years my junior. This really meant that we had little in common during our childhood. It wasn't until I left home for university that Alan was reaching an age where we could have overlapping interests. He married Chris a couple of years after our marriage, but we have always lived some distance apart and so only make occasional visits.</p>
                <p>I'm not very good at keeping in touch with people; a yearly update to people at Christmas is about all I manage. However, in the early years after university I must have kept in touch with Dick in some way or perhaps he kept in touch with me. Dick had met Kate, a nurse, and they were to marry. Since Dick's brother lived in Canada he asked me to be Best Man and invited me to dinner on Saturday 10th April at Kate's flat in North London. They also invited Angela, a school friend of Kate and who was to be Bridesmaid. Angela was a teacher and was working in Lichfield. I invited Angela to a party we were due to hold on Saturday 1st May in Derby (about 45 minutes drive from Litchfield) and she came. One thing led to another. I met her parents on Sunday 11th July and on August 19th went off on holiday to Greece for three and a half weeks. Angela came to the station to say goodbye. Then on Friday 24th September we went off camping in North Wales for the weekend. It rained, so we spent Friday night in a B&amp;B. On the Sunday I proposed. I think we were sitting in the front of my Ford Escort in a lay-by in the Llanberis Pass, in the rain, but Angela's first reaction was "I don't know"! She did then say yes. It was Friday 15th October when I told Angela's parents and then mine on the Sunday. We found an engagement ring in Tottenham on the Monday.</p>
                <p><img src="images/wedding.jpg" style="width: 400px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;">So on August 5th 1972 we were married at the Methodist Church in Chislehurst, Kent. My Mother pretty much always got her own way and in that respect Angela's parents were similar. Her mother was the dominant partner and organised our wedding. We just turned up. Otherwise our parents were poles apart. Angela's mother was a teacher and her father a quantity surveyor who had moved into being a 'special' clients interface to the construction firm for which he worked, mainly for clients in the City of London.</p>
                <p>After the wedding reception at a pub in Chislehurst (the Bulls Head I think) we drove off in Angela's light blue mini (3035 PL). We stayed overnight in a small hotel around Stoney Stratford before heading for the Lake District.</p>
                <p>We were still living in a rented house in Woolston, just outside Warington, before we moved into Highfield Road in Lymm, when we decided that we would start trying for a family. This was in October 1975 and in December 1976 Victoria was born.</p>
