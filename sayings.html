                <h1>Sayings</h1>
                <p>When I was growing up my parents, particularly my Mother, and my grandparents would use a number of 'sayings' in there everyday conversation. Many of these sayings are not used today and so I thought I would jot down some that I recall and give, at least my interpretation of, their meaning.</p>
