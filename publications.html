                <h1>Publications</h1>
                <p>It's usual for academics to maintain a list of publications, but for a non-academic it somehow seems more of an achievement to get something published. For a non-academic it also means that they can include anything, no matter how 'low-brow' the publication in which their article appears. So you can see from the list below that my publications cover quite a range; those associated with my work, those related to my PhD and those linked to my hobbies.</p>
