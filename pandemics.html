                <h1>Pandemics</h1>
                <p>I'm generally a fan of science fiction books and films, although I've never really been attracted to post-appocalyptic films. I did watch the 2007 'I Am Legend' film starring Will Smith, although I didn't fancy the 2011 film 'Contagion'. Apparently it has recently become very popular! Towards the end of April 2020 in the UK we are now in our fifth week of 'lock-down' due to the coronavirus Covid-19, with other parts of the world at different stages. Some, such as New Zealand, are starting to lift restrictions in the hope that they can contain any second spike in infections, while some African countries are only just entering the fast infection rate stage. It is impossible to fully trust the figures that are published by various countries, but as of yesterday (27th April 2020) the highest death rate per capita was to be found in Belgium, followed by Spain, Italy, France and then the UK and the Netherlands, with the US eleventh, even though they have the largest overall number (source: <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/coronavirus/">Real Clear - Politics</a>). Of course, it will have changed by tomorrow.</p>
                <p>We know that some of the deaths in the UK are under-reported. On today's (28th April) lunch-time BBC news a graph showing the total number of deaths in care homes shows a large and growing rise above the norm. However, only a relatively small percentage of these deaths are currently attributed to Covid-19. There have also been reports of countries declaring small numbers of deaths, either because they are not testing many people or for political reasons.</p>
                <p>So how is it affecting us? There is the practical, day-to-day living aspect of the lock-down and then there is the more emotional "What would happen if we caught Covid-19?" consideration. From a practical point of view we are luckier than most. Yes, events associated with the various organisations with which we are involved have been cancelled. Angela can't go to church on a Sunday morning or to her WI meetings, I can't go to IET talks, to MG club meetings or take the TC for a run. Being retired, we have no worries about loss of income, assuming that the Invensys Pension Fund remains solvent. In practice, our expenditure seems to be less than usual, even though some prices are higher. Doing the weekly accounts therefore takes less time.</p>
                <p>When the weather is fine we have been going for walks up on the Downs (some photos taken on our walks can be found <a href="../Journal/files/walks/lockdownWalks.html">here</a>) and we've gone out for a weekly supermarket shop, with the occasional walk to the butchers and green grocers in the High Street. In fact, on Saturday Angela bought some broad bean plants from the green grocers and planted them by the garage. I stay in the car at the supermarket while Angela queues, two trolleys apart and we try to maintain the recommended two meters separation with others wherever we walk.</p>
                <p>We did put our kitchen refit on hold just before the 'lock-down' was applied. So we still have the dining table and sideboard in the sitting room and a lot of kitchen utensils and tins/packets in boxes scattered around the house. We have paid a deposit and believe that the units and appliances have been delivered from the Netherlands, so hope that the kitchen shop stays in business.</p>
                <p>So we are getting out and we are getting food. We even found that the fish and chip shop is opening, so we might treat ourselves. Angela is also emailing distant friends and has quite a few telephone conversations with WI and church friends. She is part of a rota system to call those church members who are on their own. For me it is video conferencing, as well as the usual email. Our last IET committee meeting had eleven people on a Zoom call. We started half an our later than usual and were finished an hour earlier. And we didn't need to travel to Crawley. At the end, most people said "we should always hold our meetings like this".</p>
                <p>Of course, we are used to talking with our family members in far flung places using FaceTime and that continues, although I now need to talk with Dad either by phone or occasionally via FaceTime. However, that does give us cause for concern. If we were taken ill we have no one here to help us. How would Victoria and Paul find out what had happened to us? Also, what would happen to Dad? If one of us was ill then we could probably isolate one from the other. We could sleep in different rooms, sit well apart, use different bathrooms and crockery/cutlery. We have also done a little to make it easier for Victoria and Paul. We now have in our wallet/purse a list of next-of-kin, with contact details. They also have access to files that provide as much important information that we can think of; including financial. Otherwise, we are staying in the house and garden most of the time and, if we go out, we wash our hands thoroughly on our return. Angela also uses wipes on door handles, particularly the outside front door and letter box.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, we are probably watching more television. We have always been regular watchers of news reports, but now we even watch the six o'clock news as well as the lunchtime and 10 o'clock news. Although we usually start making a bedtime drink part way through the latter, when they get on to reports that we have seen earlier. Of course, it is nearly all about coronavirus and the consequences. Not really very uplifting!</p>
                <p>At the end of May we've now had over eight weeks of lockdown, but some of the restrictions are starting to be relaxed. A great deal has been written about the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic and Iâ€™m sure that a lot more will be written. You can imagine many PhD thesis focussing on some aspect of Covid-19, from the medical and health aspects to the social and mental effects of the lockdown. There will also be much documentation about the period, documentation that forms a record of a global event. My few words are simply a record of how we were affected, even if there is in practice little effect.</p>
                <p>In to June and I decided to produce another <a href="../TC4985/articles/aDayInTheLife/aDay.html">article</a> for the West Sussex MG Owners Club magazine. The intent was to produce something humorous. I think I failed!</p>
                <p>It is now early July. A couple of weeks ago people were allowed to visit beaches and ope spaces and, of course, some people went mad and beaches were packed. Tomorrow, a Saturday, pubs and restaurants can open, provided they have put virus spread mitigation measures in place. We can expect to see news reports of 'people behaving badly'. I was going to say that our daily life has not changed, but I did go into Halfords yesterday while Angela was doing our weekly shop in Sainsbury's, the first time I've been 'shopping' other than buying newspapers and bread in the village. Then today, we drove to a garden centre to get some compost. That means that the Panda was taken out twice this week and we experienced the arrows and distance markings on the floor. So perhaps we are starting to ease our lock-down.</p>
