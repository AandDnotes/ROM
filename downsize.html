                <h1>Downsizing</h1>
                <p>We had been talking about downsizing for some time, but only talking. We agreed that before it becomes too difficult we should find a smaller house with a smaller garden that was closer to local amenities. I had been looking casually for a small building plot so that we could build (or have built) a house to our own taste. What that is might have been debatable, but it would be something with a low environmental footprint. For example, screw piles rather than concrete footings, timber rather than brick/block, triple-glazed windows and lots of insulation. Power would be ground source heating and/or photovoltaic panels.</p>
                <p>However, finding such a plot proved difficult!</p>
                <p>Then, in September 2018 a friend of Angela's phoned to say that a small house near them, with a large garage, was about to come on the market and she thought it might be the sort of thing we were after.</p>
