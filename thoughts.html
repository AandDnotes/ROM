                <p>Some random thoughts.</p>
                <h2>Decisions</h2>
                <p>The decisions that we make in life, whether at home or at work, whether about what we are going to eat tonight or what colour to paint the front door of our house, are made with little, if any, knowledge of the consequences of those decisions. They tend to fall into three rough categories. About five percent move things in the right direction to varying degrees, 90 percent have no real impact, but at least do no harm and the final five percent move us in the wrong direction, from a few degrees off course to a full 180 degrees to where we want to go. I have no evidence for either the categories or the percentages, but experience in the form of 41 years of work, six years of retirement and 47 years of marriage suggest that they are not far out.</p>
                <p>The effect of decisions depends, of course, on the circumstances around the decision. If you are single, with no dependents, then the consequence of your decisions will only affect you. However, if you are managing a group or a whole company, or you have a spouse and children, then the consequences could be severe, not just on you, but on those who are dependent upon you.</p>
