                <h1>Random Thoughts</h1>
                <h2>Decisions</h2>
                <p>The decisions that we make in life, whether at home or at work, whether about what we are going to eat tonight or what colour to paint the front door of our house, are made with little, if any, knowledge of the consequences of those decisions. They tend to fall into three rough categories. About five percent move things in the right direction to varying degrees, 90 percent have no real impact, but at least do no harm and the final five percent move us in the wrong direction, from a few degrees off course to a full 180 degrees to where we want to go. I have no evidence for either the categories or the percentages, but experience in the form of 41 years of work, six years of retirement and 47 years of marriage suggest that they are not far out.</p>
                <p>The effect of decisions depends, of course, on the circumstances around the decision. If you are single, with no dependents, then the consequence of your decisions will only affect you. However, if you are managing a group or a whole company, or you have a spouse and children, then the consequences could be severe, not just on you, but on those who are dependent upon you.</p>
                <p>One of the difficulties that we have when making decisions is that we rarely have any evidence upon which to base the decision. Time pressure then means that, rather than going off to find evidence, we use 'gut feel' and make the decision there and then. Digestive systems are not really a good basis for making decisions.</p>

                <h2>People's Image</h2>
                <p>When my father was young you only had a photograph of yourself if it was taken by a professional photographer. By the time that I was young many people had a 'box brownie' and took their own photos, twelve on a roll of film, and took them to the chemist to be developed and printed; still in black and white. As a teenager we had moving pictures in the form of an 8mm cine camera. And it was in colour. This meant that we could not only record what someone looked like, but how they moved. Although there was still no sound, edited and spliced-in captions could give the viewer some idea of what was going on.</p>
                <p>By the time that we had children of our own we were on to 35mm film, with up to 36 frames per film canister. However, we still had to send them away to be developed and printed and they were still put in boxes or draws, perhaps with a few going into albums, and rarely viewed. If we were organised, we made a note of when and where each photo was taken and wrote on the back of the prints.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, we have digital cameras and phones that will take high resolution still photos and videos. The still images have embedded data saying when they were taken and perhaps also where. And the video clips have sound. At last we can record what people looked like, what they were doing, how they moved and how they sounded. The down side it that these images are now stored on the portable devices on which they were taken and in folders and databases on desktop or laptop computers or on servers that provide 'free' storage space. Finding a particular image or video is only a little easier than finding a print in a paper wallet in a drawer.</p>
                <p>Being able to record and view a broader 'picture' of a person helps those who don't know the individual to get a better impression of who they were. However, if we want to know how a person influenced the people and the environment in which they lived then we need to do more than record events as they happen, particularly more than just 'holiday snaps'. We also need to collate the information, rather than leave it disbursed around multiple files 'in the cloud'. However, that takes effort and organisation and a desire to set out to record a truer image of an individual for those who come later to view. Unless we have done something notable during our lives that results in the awarding of a medal, a title or a certificate or we have a collection of press cuttings, our achievements will fade as those who have first hand recollections pass.</p>
                <p>From personal experience it is hard to piece together the 'life' of an individual towards the end of that person's life or after their death. If they are an ordinary person there will probably be little evidence of their life other than a few untitled photographs along with birth and death certificates. Yet their lives were full of events, tragedies and celebrations. They brought up children and made sacrifices for their family. All these things are worthy of recording so as to help future generations understand their own position in history.</p>
