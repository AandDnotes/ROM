                <h1>A Career or Two</h1>
                <p>During my time studying physics and the University of Lancaster I became convinced that the future lay with nuclear power. I thought that fusiion power would be the most interesting, since it hadn't yet been achieved, but after a little research I decided that the maths was far too heavy for me. So I turned to fission power. I had offers for a PhD in high energy nuclear physics and another to continue my undergratuate project on single crystal graphite, but I wanted to do something that I though would make a difference. For high energy pysics I would be one person working on a very small part of a very large project with a very large team. The professor responsible for the graphite work only seemed interested in pure research, whereas I was already thinking about practical applications.</p>
                <p>I also had an offer of a place on the MSc Nuclear Engineering course at Birmingham University and an offer of a Graduate Apprenticeship at Rolls Royce and Associated in Derby. RR&amp;A designed nuclear reactor plant for submarines and the graduate apprenticeship involved moving around several departments in the first year, including a term at the Royal Navel College in Greenwich. So in September 1969 I joined RR&amp;A, working in the Physics, Structural Engineering and Test Instrumentation departments, as well as the spell in Greenwich. At the end of the year I joined a small team (three of us and led by Paddy Stone) who developed the computing tools that were used by those doing the physics design of the reactor core. Basically they had to work out the power generated in each part of the reactor and how this would vary over the core's lifetime.</p>
                <p>I think that it was in 1972 that John Taylor, my friend from Lancaster, and who did the course at Birmingham joined the radiation shilding group (also in the Physics Department) at RR&amp;A. Then at another forgotten date Paddy left to become a teacher and John was given his job. This was quite a blow. His group leader, with whom I played hockey, explained that he pushed his people forward, but my group leader apparently never talked of his staff. It then wasn't very long before John moved to a group in Warrington who either ran the Sellafield site in Cumbria or did a lot of work for them. So I was given the sction leader job, much to the annoyance of Judy McNicholas who was the other member of the team. She thought that she should have got the job. Judy had joined RR&amp;A because her fiance paul, and engineer, already worked for RR&amp;A. In fact Judy and Paul and Angela and I got married on the same day and Paul (an 18 stone rubgy player) and I had a joint stag party. We ended up being chained together!</p>
                <p>One of the problems with doing work funded by the MoD was that every two years, or there abouts, they would cancel the contract and we would start on something new. In 1975 this happened again and so I looked for a job in the civil nuclear raactor field. I failed to get a job with the UK Atomic Energy Authority, but I did with the National Nuclear Corporation (which might have been called the Nuclear Power Company at the time), who were designing the next generation of civil reactors. I started with them on 20th October 1975, working in a group led by Alan Goode. It was quite a change, using different computer systems and doing design analysis rather than developing tools. However, after two years the contract on which we were working was cancelled!</p>
                <p>Angela saw an advertisement in a local newspaper about an 'open evening' to find out more about Ferranti Computer Systems, so I went along and was invited for an interview. I can't actually remember the interview, but I started work at FCS on Monday 6th February 1978. Now this was a complete change!</p>
