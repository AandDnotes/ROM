                <h1>A Career or Two</h1>
                <p>During my time studying physics and the University of Lancaster I became convinced that the future lay with nuclear power. I thought that fusion power would be the most interesting, since it hadn't yet been achieved, but after a little research I decided that the maths was far too heavy for me. So I turned to fission power. I had offers for a PhD in high energy nuclear physics and another to continue my undergraduate project on single crystal graphite, but I wanted to do something that I though would make a difference. For high energy physics I would be one person working on a very small part of a very large project with a very large team. The professor responsible for the graphite work only seemed interested in pure research, whereas I was already thinking about practical applications.</p>
                <p>I also had an offer of a place on the MSc Nuclear Engineering course at Birmingham University and an offer of a Graduate Apprenticeship at Rolls Royce and Associated in Derby. RR&amp;A designed nuclear reactor plant for submarines and the graduate apprenticeship involved moving around several departments in the first year, including a term at the Royal Navel College in Greenwich. So in September 1969 I joined RR&amp;A, working in the Physics, Structural Engineering and Test Instrumentation departments, as well as the spell in Greenwich. At the end of the year I joined a small team (three of us and led by Paddy Stone) who developed the computing tools that were used by those doing the physics design of the reactor core. Basically they had to work out the power generated in each part of the reactor and how this would vary over the core's lifetime.</p>
                <p>I think that it was in 1972 that John Taylor, my friend from Lancaster, and who did the course at Birmingham joined the radiation shielding group (also in the Physics Department) at RR&amp;A. Then at another forgotten date Paddy left to become a teacher and John was given his job. This was quite a blow. His group leader, with whom I played hockey, explained that he pushed his people forward, but my group leader apparently never talked of his staff. It then wasn't very long before John moved to a group in Warrington who either ran the Sellafield site in Cumbria or did a lot of work for them. So I was given the section leader job, much to the annoyance of Judy McNicholas who was the other member of the team. She thought that she should have got the job. Judy had joined RR&amp;A because her fianc√© paul, and engineer, already worked for RR&amp;A. In fact Judy and Paul and Angela and I got married on the same day and Paul (an 18 stone rugby player) and I had a joint stag party. We ended up being chained together!</p>
                <p>One of the problems with doing work funded by the MoD was that every two years, or there a-bouts, they would cancel the contract and we would start on something new. In 1975 this happened again and so I looked for a job in the civil nuclear reactor field. I failed to get a job with the UK Atomic Energy Authority, but I did with the National Nuclear Corporation (which might have been called the Nuclear Power Company at the time), who were designing the next generation of civil reactors. I started with them on 20th October 1975, working in a group led by Alan Goode. It was quite a change, using different computer systems and doing design analysis rather than developing tools. However, after two years the contract on which we were working was cancelled!</p>
                <p>Angela saw an advertisement in a local newspaper about an 'open evening' to find out more about Ferranti Computer Systems, so I went along and was then invited for an interview. I can't actually remember the interview, but I started work at FCS on Monday 6th February 1978 as a project programmer. Now this was a complete change!</p>
                <p>FCS was the only division of Ferranti that did not do any military work. They designed and built their own range of mini-computers (the Argus 700 range at the time), along with all the other electronics needed to interface the computer to sensors and actuators to control process plant. They also wrote their own real-time operating system, compiler (for Coral) and utilities. The company addressed a number of markets, but in the industrial sector the tackled process control, power generation and electricity distribution. In the first of these they had developed a package called PMS (Process Management System) which Following some training courses I was assigned to a project that was to provide a control system for BP Chemicals at their Barry site. During the course of the project I went from project programmer to team lead to project manager.</p>
                <p>One thing led to another, leader of the Shell North Sea software team, Deputy Project Group Manager (while the manager was on a one-year 'course'), Project Group Manager (when he returned and was assigned another job) and then Business Manager, responsible for three project groups and about 120 people. Then things started falling apart. Actually I wasn't very good at managing people. A colleague left when I got promoted, but then his 'drinking partner' became general manager and he was brought back after my boss and my peers were made redundant. I was put in charge of software development, with two different groups, each working in opposite directions. It wasn't long before I was told that I would take voluntary redundancy! All that took 15 years.</p>
                <p>So in 1990 I moved to being Software Manager for Realm Control Systems. The only problem was that they were in Crawley. This meant moving south, changing the children's schools, leaving friends and organisations in Lymm. I moved down on my own for six months and in June we moved into Kingsmead Close, which we thought was in Steyning. It turned out to be in Bramber, but was equidistant from the centre of both.</p>
