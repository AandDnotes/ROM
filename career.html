                <h1>A Career or Two</h1>
                <p>Whilst at school I had a number of Saturday jobs, the best being with Sainsbury's in Potters Bar High Street. However, my first 'full time' job was with Friern Barnet council, initially as an assistant caretaker at a school and then at the council office. I did this work during each of my summer holidays while at university. At the end of my first year, the job allowed me to earn enough to buy my first car.</p>
                <p>During my time studying physics at the University of Lancaster I became convinced that the future lay with nuclear power. I thought that fusion power would be the most interesting, since it hadn't yet been achieved, but after a little research I decided that the maths was far too heavy for me. So I turned to fission power. I had offers at Lancaster for a PhD in high energy nuclear physics and another to continue my undergraduate project on single crystal graphite, but I wanted to do something that I though would make a difference. For high energy physics I would be one person working on a very small part of a very large project with a very large team. The professor responsible for the graphite work only seemed interested in pure research, whereas I was already thinking about practical applications. I'm sure that having these two offers was the only reason that I managed to get a 2:1.</p>
                <p>I also had an offer of a place on the MSc Nuclear Engineering course at Birmingham University and an offer of a Graduate Apprenticeship at Rolls Royce and Associated in Derby. RR&amp;A designed nuclear reactor plant for submarines and the graduate apprenticeship involved moving around several departments in the first year, including a term at the Royal Navel College in Greenwich. So in September 1969 I joined RR&amp;A, working in the Physics, Structural Engineering and Test Instrumentation departments, as well as the spell in Greenwich. At the end of the year I joined a small team (three of us, led by Paddy Stone) who developed the computing tools that were used by those doing the physics design of the reactor core. Basically they had to work out the power generated in each part of the reactor and how this would vary over the core's lifetime. In the early 70s we were still at the stage of using mainframe computers, submitting our stack of punched cards and getting back the resulting print-out. So software development could take quite a long time.</p>
                <p>I think that it was in 1972 that John Taylor, my friend from Lancaster, and who did the course at Birmingham, joined the radiation shielding group (also in the Physics Department) at RR&amp;A. Then at another forgotten date Paddy left to become a teacher and John was given his job. This was quite a blow. His group leader, with whom I played hockey, explained that he pushed his people forward, but my group leader apparently never talked of his staff. It then wasn't very long before John moved to a group in Warrington who either ran the Sellafield site in Cumbria or did a lot of work for them. So I was given the section leader job, much to the annoyance of Judy McNicholas who was the other member of the team. She thought that she should have got the job. Judy had joined RR&amp;A because her fianc√© Paul, an engineer, already worked for RR&amp;A. In fact Judy and Paul and Angela and I got married on the same day and Paul (an 18 stone rugby player) and I had a joint stag party. We ended up being chained together!</p>
                <p>One of the problems with doing work funded by the MoD was that every two years, or there a-bouts, they would cancel the contract and we would start on something new. In 1975 this happened again and so I looked for a job in the civil nuclear reactor field. I failed to get a job with the UK Atomic Energy Authority, but I did with the National Nuclear Corporation (which might have been called the Nuclear Power Company at the time), who were designing the next generation of civil reactors. I started with them on 20th October 1975, working in a group led by Alan Goode. It was quite a change, using different computer systems and doing design analysis rather than developing tools. However, after two years the contract on which we were working was cancelled!</p>
                <p>You can find out more about the type of work that I did in the field of nuclear reactor design <a href="reactors/reactors.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Just after that, Angela saw an advertisement in a local newspaper about an 'open evening' to find out more about Ferranti Computer Systems, so I went along and was then invited for an interview. I can't actually remember the interview, but I started work at FCS in south Manchester on Monday 6th February 1978 as a project programmer. Now this was a complete change!</p>
                <p>FCS was the only division of Ferranti that did not do any military work. They designed and built their own range of mini-computers (the Argus 700 range at the time), along with all the other electronics needed to interface the computer to sensors and actuators to control process plant. They also wrote their own real-time operating system, compiler (for the Coral language) and utilities. The company addressed a number of markets, but in the industrial sector they tackled process control, power generation and electricity distribution. In the first of these they had developed a package called PMS (Process Management System). Following some training courses I was assigned to a project that was to provide a control system for BP Chemicals at their Barry site to make PVC. During the course of the project I went from project programmer to team lead to project manager. Although each project would start with the current release of the PMS software system, they would modify the code to fix problems and adapt it for their use. In our case the project was using the latest input/output hardware modules (quite large PCBs that plugged into a backplane) for monitoring and controling the plant. But the drivers (low-level software modules) were not available, so we had to write our own! The application to control the plant to make PVC was then written in the PMS configuration language. For our project this was done by the engineer contractor that was building the plant.</p>
                <p>One thing then led to another; I became leader of the Shell North Sea software team, then Deputy Project Group Manager (while the manager was on a one-year 'course'), Project Group Manager (when he returned and was assigned another job) and then Business Manager, responsible for three project groups and about 120 people. A little while later things started falling apart. Actually I wasn't very good at managing people. A colleague (another project group manager) left when I got promoted, but then his 'drinking partner' became general manager and he was brought back after my boss and my peers were made redundant. I was told that I'd only survived because of my technical knowledge and I was put in charge of software development, with two different groups, each working in completely opposite directions. One was developing PMS and the other a separate software system for power station control and being developed in Ada. It wasn't long before I was told that I would take voluntary redundancy! All that took 15 years. Not long after I left, the whole Ferranti company collapsed, having been defrauded by an American company they had bought.</p>
                <p>So in 1990 I moved to being Software Manager for Realm Control Systems. The only problem was that they were in Crawley. This meant moving south, changing the children's schools, leaving friends and organisations in Lymm. I've always felt guilty about inflicting this on us all, but I needed an income. I moved down on my own for six months and in June we moved into Kingsmead Close, which we thought was in Steyning. It turned out to be in Bramber, but was equidistant from the centre of both. At the time it was the biggest house (bungalow) that we could afford in the area we wanted to live.</p>
                <p>However, my time with Realm only lasted just over a year. One day I was told that they could no longer afford to employ me and I was made redundant. Shortly after, they went out of business. I had spoken with TCS (Turnbull Control Systems) in Worthing before moving to Realm and in November 1991 I joined their Offshore Oil and Gas group. The Eurotherm group had a number of small companies, all around Worthing, each initially run by one of the Eurotherm founders. The then MD had an American friend who told him about me while I was still working for Ferranti. I had tried to get Ferranti to form a relationship with a Boston-based start-up called DAS. This hadn't worked out, but led to my joining TCS. However, the directors of TCS were always uncomfortable about the large systems we were trying to sell. The company was built around 'boxed products' and small systems. So after a couple of years the group was disbanded and later I was made redundant again.</p>
                <p>One of the bigger players in the control system business and a competitor of both FCS and TCS was Foxboro. They were basically a US company, based in Foxboro, Massachusetts, but had their main UK office in Crawley. In November 1994 I joined them as Principal Engineer. When I started with them they were owned by Siebe, a British company. Later they merged with another group and became Invensys. A short while after I retired, 18&frac12; years later, Invensys was bought by the French company Schneider Electric.</p>
                <p>During my time with Invensys I led projects, became one of a few batch control specialists (which took me around the world), worked with an international pharmaceutical marketing group and became part of a special project group aimed at increasing our engineering efficiency, which morphed into an international team. My role in that team concerned the development of engineering tools. However, although we developed a number of tools, using a software team in Hyderabad, I failed to convince the company to develop what I still think was really needed. So I was ready to retire on the 1st July 2013.</p>
