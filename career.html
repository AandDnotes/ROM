                <h1>A Career or Two</h1>
                <p>During my time studying physics and the University of Lancaster I became convinced that the future lay with nuclear power. I though that fusiion power would be the most interesting, since it hadn't yet been achieved, but the after a little research I decided that the maths was far too heavy for me. So I turned to fission power. I had offers for a PhD in high energy nuclear physics and another to continue my undergratuate project on single crystal graphite, but I wanted to do something that I though would make a difference. For high energy pysics I would be one person working on a very small part of a very large project with a very large team. The professor responsible for teh graphite work only seemed interested in pure research, whereas I was already thinking about practical applications.</p>
