                <h1>A Timeline of my Life</h1>
                <p>On our <a href="https://aanddnotes.github.io/WebPages/welcome.html">web site</a> I have two pages, one called Events and one called Year Notes. However, the events listed only started in 2007, with Victoria's wedding, and the year notes (a summary of the year's events) didn't start until 2010. On the basis that there must have been a few other notable events since 1948 I thought I would start by simply making a list. It is perhaps a little pretentious to call it a timeline, mainly because it isn't a line and is not to scale. Also it runs from the present (or the last time that I added an event) backwards in time. According to Carlo Rovelli<sup>1</sup> time is really just a set of events and we percieve the flow of time due to our ability to remember events and project into the 'future'. So what you see below is just events drawn from my memory (actually, mainly documents) with the dates that we attached to them due to our labelling of flowing time.</p>
