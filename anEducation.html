                <h1>An Education</h1>
                <p>Someone must have said that learning is a lifetime activity and that has certainly been my experience. However, my early education didn't get off to a flying start. I previously mentioned my first day at school in September 1953 at the age of nearly five and a half. This event took place at Gews Corner School in Cheshunt, which is apparently now called Millbrook School. It was a Victorian school, built in 1909 and seems to look the same today.</p>
                <p>My memory of infant school otherwise seems to be non-existent! I think that I had moved up to the junior school when we moved from Cheshunt to Edmonton in Middlesex (a county which no longer exists). We lived in a block of flats in Charlton Road, just a short walk from Cuckoo Hall Lane School. The primary school (infants and junior) is now called Woodpecker Hall Academy and the secondary school on the same site is Cuckoo Hall Academy. At that time Cuckoo Hall Lane Junior school was a 'modern', single-storey, flat roofed building with green spaces between the 'arms' of the classrooms. My early education must have made a big impression on me, since I can only remember the general appearance of the school and that, in a higher year, were a set of quins.</p>
                <p>I must have been nine years old when we moved to Potters Bar, swapping our council flat for an end of terrace house on the 'Edmonton estate' and went to Parkfield Junior School in The Walk. My first memory is wandering alone around the playground at break, looking for a boy that I'd known in Edmonton, although I don't recall ever becoming friendly with him. Parkfield had been the 'senior' school until Mount Grace was opened and the infant school was still Ladbrooke in the High Street, but the first two years of Mount Grace were housed in huts on the Parkfield site. It seems that the school was rebuilt as an infant and junior school in 1998 and named Ladbrooke JMI School.</p>
                <p>In a way, my time at Parkfield was quite significant in my education. In the 'third year' I was in the top class, taught by a Mr King. I think that I struggled generally, particularly with reading and spelling. After a while we were given the list of words to learn for our weekly spelling test. As a result I went from getting few right to getting them all right. However, I recall that Mr King set us 'assignments' to do at home. I had trouble with these and my parents,although they tried, couldn't help me. In the end they opted me out of doing assignments. Mr King seemed to be respected by everyone, including my parents, but he had a nasty streak. On one occasion he asked one child a question, getting them to stand up when they couldn't answer it. He then asked the same question to each of the other children who didn't do assignments, in the end having us all standing and pointing out to the class that none of us did assignments. At the end of the year he 'suggested' that I would find it easier if I went down to the next class in my fourth and final year at the school.</p>
                <p>I certainly have better memories of my final year at Parkfield, but I can't recall any preparation towards the 11+ exam, which was used to decide whether a child went to a Grammar School or a Secondary Modern School. My only recollection is sitting in a room and doing some tests. The letter we received said that I had failed.</p>
                
                <p>Mount Grace Comprehensive School, Potters Bar. For the first two years at the Lower School on the same site as Parkfield Junior and then at the Upper School.</p>
