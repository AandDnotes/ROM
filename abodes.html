                <h1>Places I've Lived</h1>
                <p>This is really just a list of places where I've lived, together with a note about each and perhaps a photo if one is available. Naturally we'll start at the beginning and work through in chronological order. I was born in North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton. I think the hospital still exists, but the county of Middlesex was mainly absormed by Greater London in 1965.</p>

                  <tr>
                    <th>Alpha Road, Edmonton</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><img src="images/AlphaRoad.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;">I can remember my grand parents living in Alpha Road when I was a boy, but it seems that when I was born we had a flat in one of the houses in Alpha Road. It was a street of mailly terraced victorian houses and I belive that we had an upstairs flat in one of them. It seems that the owner of the house got married and his wife did not want tenanats, so took us to court to get us evicted.</td>

                  <tr>
                    <th>Whitefield Road, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><img src="images/WhitefieldRoad.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;">I can only assume that we moved from Alpha Road to a 'council house' in Cheshunt. Certainly I started school in Cheshunt and my brother Alan was born there. We had a maisonette in the form of the top two floors in a three story block. My only real recollection of the place is that it had a tiled floor. We had pet mice, which would escape and go under the sofa. So we would use a long broom handle to slide them across the floor into someone's waiting hands.</td>

                    <th>Chalton Road, Edmonton</th>

                  <tr>
                    <td><img src="images/CharltonRoad.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;">Cheshunt was a pleasant place, but walking anywhere locally generally meant crossing a busy road, it was a long way from where Dad was working and Mum felt it was a long way from her mother in Edmonton. So we arranged for a transfer to a council flat in Edmonton. Again memories are scant, but I do recall playing with friends, building model aircraft from Kielcraft kits with Dad, flying them from the window and them crashing into the communal washing line posts below. I also remember my Mother taking Alan to the shops (in his pram) and leaving me alone at home. This frightened me (and was probably illegal, even at that time) until I was bought jigsaw puzzles to do while she was out.</td>
