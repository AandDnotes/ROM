                <h1>Places I've Lived</h1>
                <p>This is really just a list of places where I've lived, together with a note about each and perhaps a photo if one is available. Naturally we'll start at the beginning and work through in chronological order. I was born in North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton. I think the hospital still exists, but the county of Middlesex was mainly absormed by Greater London in 1965.</p>

                    <td>I can remember my grand parents living in Alpha Road when I was a boy, but it seems that when I was born we had a flat in one of the houses in Alpha Road. It was a street of mailly terraced victorian houses and I belive that we had an upstairs flat in one of them. It seems that the owner of the house got married and his wife did not want tenanats, so took us to court to get us evicted.</td>
